## Overview

This document outlines the major bugs that were discovered and resolved in the Lead Capture & Confirmation App, including improvements to data handling and email confirmation logic.
---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Duplicate Confirmation Email Function Call Removed

**File**: [`src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`](src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx)  

**Severity**: Major  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

The form submission handler called the `send-confirmation` Supabase Edge Function twice in succession, resulting in:

-   Duplicate confirmation emails being sent to users
-   Unnecessary load on the Edge Function and email provider
-   Confusing user experience

#### Root Cause

A copy-paste or merge error led to two separate invocations of the same function with identical payloads, one inside a try/catch and another immediately after.

#### Fix

Removed the redundant call, ensuring the confirmation email is only sent once per form submission:

```typescript
// Removed duplicate call to supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation', ...)
```

#### Impact

-   Only one confirmation email is sent per lead submission
-   Reduced load on backend and email provider
-   Cleaner, more maintainable code

### 2. Runtime Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')

**File**: [`src/components/ui/chart.tsx`](src/components/ui/chart.tsx)

**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

The application crashed with the error:  
`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')`  
This occurred when rendering charts, causing the UI to break and preventing users from viewing analytics.

#### Root Cause

The code attempted to call `.replace()` on a value that could be `undefined` if the React `useId()` hook or the `id` prop was not a string.

#### Fix

Added type checks to ensure `.replace()` is only called on a string:

```typescript
const uniqueId = React.useId();
const safeUniqueId = typeof uniqueId === "string" ? uniqueId : "";
const chartId = `chart-${
    typeof id === "string" && id ? id : safeUniqueId.replace(/:/g, "")
}`;
```

#### Impact

-   Prevented runtime crashes in the chart component
-   Improved robustness of chart rendering

### 3. Edge Function: Non-2xx Status & Email Not Sent

**File**: [`supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`](supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts)

**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

The confirmation email function returned a non-2xx status code, causing the client to receive a `FunctionsHttpError` and not send confirmation emails.

#### Root Cause

-   The OpenAI API response was parsed incorrectly using `choices[1]` instead of `choices[0]`, resulting in `undefined` content.
-   The code called `.replace()` on possibly `undefined` content, causing a runtime error and a 500 response.

#### Fix

-   Corrected the OpenAI response parsing:
    ```typescript
    return data?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content;
    ```
-   Ensured `.replace()` is only called on a string:
    ```typescript
    ${(personalizedContent || '').replace(/\n/g, '<br>')}
    ```

#### Impact

-   Confirmation emails are now sent reliably
-   Edge Function returns correct status codes
-   Improved error handling and logging

### 4. Lead Data Not Persisted in Database

**File**: [`src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`](src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx)  

**Severity**: Major  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

Lead form submissions were not being saved to the Supabase `leads` table, risking data loss if email sending failed.

#### Root Cause

The Edge Function only sent emails and did not persist the lead data to the database.

#### Fix

Added logic to insert the lead data into the `leads` table using the Supabase Deno client:

```typescript
const { error: dbError } = await supabase
    .from("leads")
    .insert([{ name, email, industry }]);
if (dbError) {
    // handle error
}
```

#### Impact

-   All lead submissions are now reliably stored in the database
-   Data integrity and auditability improved
